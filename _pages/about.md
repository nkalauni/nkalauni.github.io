I am a B.E. Civil Engineering graduate from IOE Pulchowk Campus and I am currently working as a research assistant at Center for Water Resource Studies under the supervision of [Professor Vishnu Prasad Pandey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pp_w84AAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research here involves improving the predictive performance of hydrologic models in snow-fed catchments of Nepal. To this end, we are exploring ways to integrate remotely sensed data into a simple ODE-system-based model by leveraging recent advances in [differentiable modeling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26107-z) or [scientific machine learning](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/5085/2022/). Broadly speaking, I am interested in the development and application of numerical and scientific machine learning models in the greater field of earth system sciences.

Prior to Pulchowk, I won the Nepal Physics Olympiad (NePhO) 2018 and represented Nepal in the International Physics Olympiad [(IPhO) 2018, Lisbon](http://web.archive.org/web/20230528142145/https://ipho2018.pt/content/delegations/nepal). Frustrated by the lack of resources when preparing for national and international physics olympiad, I collaborated with my IPhO colleagues to release an [open-source book](https://github.com/nkalauni/physics-olympiad-book) on physics olympiad preparation for Nepali olympiad aspirants. In my free time, I enjoy playing [chess](https://lichess.org/@/svidler_simp), solving sudokus and reading fiction.
