<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a B.E. Civil Engineering graduate from IOE Pulchowk Campus and I am currently working as a research assistant at Center for Water Resource Studies under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pp_w84AAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Vishnu Prasad Pandey</a>. My current research here involves improving the predictive performance of hydrologic models in snow-fed catchments of Nepal. To this end, we are exploring ways to integrate remotely sensed data into a simple ODE-system-based model by leveraging recent advances in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26107-z" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">differentiable modeling</a> or <a href="https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/5085/2022/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">scientific machine learning</a>. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the development and application of numerical and scientific machine learning models in the greater field of earth system sciences.</p> <p>Prior to Pulchowk, I won the Nepal Physics Olympiad (NePhO) 2018 and represented Nepal in the International Physics Olympiad <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230528142145/https://ipho2018.pt/content/delegations/nepal" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(IPhO) 2018, Lisbon</a>. Frustrated by the lack of resources when preparing for national and international physics olympiad, I collaborated with my IPhO colleagues to release an <a href="https://github.com/nkalauni/physics-olympiad-book" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">open-source book</a> on physics olympiad preparation for Nepali olympiad aspirants. In my free time, I enjoy playing <a href="https://lichess.org/@/svidler_simp" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">chess</a>, solving sudokus and reading fiction.</p> </body></html>
